| `customerID`       | Unique identifier for each customer.                                                                                                           |     Data joins, traceability, linking back to records, splitting train/test by customer if needed. | **Keep in raw/metadata**, **drop for modeling** (or keep only for analysis). Do not use as a feature — it provides no predictive signal. Use it to map model outputs back to customers.                                                                                                                           |
| `gender`           | Customer gender: `Male`, `Female`.                                                                                                             |                                                   Demographic analysis, bias checks, segmentation. | **Keep.** Convert to binary or one-hot if you want to use it. Also consider whether to include it depending on fairness constraints.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `SeniorCitizen`    | Binary indicator (0/1) whether customer is 65+.                                                                                                |                               Demographic risk factor; can correlate with service usage and churn. | **Keep.** Cast to boolean or categorical (`senior`, `not_senior`). Consider interaction terms with services.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `Partner`          | Whether customer has a partner: `Yes`/`No`.                                                                                                    |                                Demographic segmentation; may affect churn (households vs singles). | **Keep.** Encode as 0/1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `Dependents`       | Whether customer has dependents: `Yes`/`No`.                                                                                                   |                                               Demographics, household needs and revenue potential. | **Keep.** Encode as 0/1. Consider deriving `household_size` if additional data is available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Also useful for segmentation and cohort analysis.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `PhoneService`     | Whether customer has home phone service: `Yes`/`No`.                                                                                           |                                                         Service adoption, basic service indicator. | **Keep.** Encode as 0/1. Note: many customers with `No` may also have `No internet service` for internet-related features — check consistency.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `MultipleLines`    | Whether customer has multiple phone lines: `Yes`/`No`/`No phone service`.                                                                      |                                        Shows higher-tier phone usage; can indicate customer value. | **Keep.** Clean values: treat `No phone service` as separate category or map to `No` with a separate flag. Use one-hot or ordinal encoding.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `InternetService`  | Type of internet service: `DSL`, `Fiber optic`, `No`.                                                                                          |      Strong predictor: fiber tends to higher churn in some studies; service quality affects churn. | **Keep.** One-hot encode (`internet_dsl`, `internet_fiber`, `internet_none`). Consider combining with streaming features.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `OnlineSecurity`   | Whether customer has online security add-on: `Yes`/`No`/`No internet service`.                                                                 |                                             Upsell/ bundle info, customer value, service adoption. | **Keep.** Clean `No internet service` separately. Use encoding consistent with other add-on features.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `OnlineBackup`     | Whether customer has online backup add-on.                                                                                                     |                                                                                     Same as above. | **Keep.** Encode and treat `No internet service` properly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `DeviceProtection` | Device protection plan subscription.                                                                                                           |                                            Upsell info, potential revenue, correlation with churn. | **Keep.** Encode; check for `No internet service` vs `No`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `TechSupport`      | Premium tech support subscription: `Yes`/`No`/`No internet service`.                                                                           |                                                      Service satisfaction proxy; may reduce churn. | **Keep.** Encode; good candidate interaction with `Contract` and `tenure`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Consider aggregating streaming features into `streaming_count` or `uses_streaming`.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Contract`         | Contract type: `Month-to-month`, `One year`, `Two year`.                                                                                       |                                           Strong predictor — month-to-month tends to higher churn. | **Keep.** Ordinal-ish: map to short-term/long-term or one-hot. Very important for modeling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Consider interactions with `PaymentMethod`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `PaymentMethod`    | How the customer pays: `Electronic check`, `Mailed check`, `Bank transfer (automatic)`, `Credit card (automatic)` (values vary across copies). |    Payment friction indicator — `Electronic check` often correlates with higher churn in analyses. | **Keep.** One-hot encode; may reveal strong patterns (e.g., high churn with electronic check). Consider grouping `automatic` vs `manual`.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `MonthlyCharges`   | Current total monthly charge.                                                                                                                  |                        Direct revenue signal (ARPU), important for segmentation and CLTV modeling. | **Keep.** Numeric — may need scaling. Consider winsorizing outliers and creating `avg_monthly_charges` or interactions with tenure.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `TotalCharges`     | Total charges to date (string in some copies, may contain blanks).                                                                             | Cumulative revenue per customer; strong signal for customer value and possible data errors to fix. | **Keep.** Convert to numeric (coerce errors); check and impute missing (empty strings for new customers). Derive `avg_charge_per_month = TotalCharges / tenure` (handle tenure=0). Be careful: some rows show `TotalCharges` empty — convert to NaN and impute 0 or `MonthlyCharges`×tenure depending on context. |
| `Churn`            | Target variable: `Yes` if customer left within the last month, `No` otherwise.                                                                 |                         Target for supervised models; also used to compute churn rate and metrics. | **Keep.** Convert to binary label (1 = churn, 0 = stay). Be aware of imbalance (typically \~26% churn). Use stratified splits for train/test.                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Additional recommendations & notes

* **Drop vs keep summary**: keep all columns for EDA and feature engineering. For modeling, drop `customerID`. All others are useful; some (like add-on features with `No internet service`) need careful cleaning and consistent encoding.

* **TotalCharges cleanup**: many Kaggle notebooks convert `TotalCharges` to numeric using `pd.to_numeric(df['TotalCharges'], errors='coerce')` and then handle NaNs. Check for empty strings — these correspond to tenure = 0 customers in some datasets.

* **Categorical encoding**: For binary `Yes/No` columns, map to 1/0. For multi-class (e.g., `InternetService`, `PaymentMethod`, `Contract`) prefer one-hot encoding or target encoding depending on model.

* **Feature engineering ideas**:

  * `tenure_bucket` (0–12, 13–24, etc.)
  * `avg_charge_per_month = TotalCharges/tenure` (handle tenure=0)
  * `services_count` = count of `Yes` across service add-ons (OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies)
  * `has_internet = InternetService != 'No'`
  * `is_autopay` vs `manual_pay` grouping from `PaymentMethod`

* **Imbalance handling**: Churn is usually imbalanced (\~20–30% churn). Use stratified sampling, class weights, or resampling techniques.

* **Privacy / fairness**: decide whether to include demographic-sensitive features (e.g., `gender`, `SeniorCitizen`) depending on fairness/privacy goals. Use them for analysis but consider excluding from production models if needed.

* **Data splits**: if you have time-based effects, consider using `tenure` or signup date (if available) for time-aware splits. Otherwise, use stratified random splits on `Churn`.
